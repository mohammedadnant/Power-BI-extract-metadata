Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! Your support helps make this tool more useful for everyone.

Please follow these guidelines when contributing code, docs, or reporting issues.

1) Before you start
-------------------
- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating work.
- If you plan a larger change, open an issue first to discuss the proposed approach.

2) How to contribute code
-------------------------
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:

  git checkout -b feat/short-description

- Make small, focused commits with clear messages. Use present-tense and reference issues when relevant.
- Keep secrets out of commits. Never commit `config.txt` with real credentials.
- Run the script locally to validate changes where applicable.

3) Pull request process
-----------------------
- Open a pull request against `main` and use the repository PR template.
- In your PR include a short description, rationale, and any manual test steps.
- A maintainer will review and may request changes; please respond to feedback in a timely way.

4) Code style and tests
-----------------------
- Keep changes small and readable; prefer clarity over cleverness.
- If you add functionality, include or update documentation in `README.md`.
- Add tests if the change is non-trivial; the project currently has no automated test harness, so include manual test steps in the PR if needed.

5) Reporting security issues
---------------------------
- If you find a security issue (exposed credentials, secrets, etc.) do NOT open a public issue. Instead, contact the repository owner directly and rotate any compromised secrets.

6) Issues
---------
- When filing an issue, include:
  - A clear title
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment information (OS, PowerShell version)

7) License and Code of Conduct
------------------------------
- This project uses the MIT license (see `LICENSE`). By contributing, you agree to license your contributions under the same terms.

Thanks again â€” contributions are appreciated!
