# Requirements for Power BI Extract Metadata

# This repository is a PowerShell-based tool. There are no Python packages.
# Use this file to list runtime dependencies and tools contributors need to run
# and develop the project.

[Runtime]
PowerShell: Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7.x
Microsoft ADOMD.NET (ADOMD) runtime: Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.dll
  Typical install: ADOMD.NET 16.x (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/adomd/adomd-net?view=asallproducts-allversions)
Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.dll
  Bundled with Tabular Editor or Analysis Services client libraries. (Script references path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Tabular Editor\Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.dll)

[Power BI / Azure prerequisites]
Power BI tenant with XMLA endpoint enabled (Premium / PPU or dedicated capacity)
Service Principal (Azure AD App) with client secret and access to target workspaces
Power BI tenant settings allowing service principals to access APIs (admin setting)

[Optional tooling]
Git (command line) — required for contribution and publishing
GitHub CLI (`gh`) — optional, used for repository visibility edits and other automation
BFG or git-filter-repo — optional, used to scrub secrets from git history if needed

[Notes]
- The scripts reference local DLL paths; if you have different install locations update the paths in the PowerShell script.
- There are no pip/npm dependencies. If you expect platform-specific packages (e.g., for running on Linux with PowerShell Core), list them here.
- Keep secrets out of the repository. Use `config.txt` as an example file only.
